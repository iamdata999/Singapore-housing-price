* Summary:
The Power BI visualizations display the sum of minimum and maximum selling prices for different room types and towns. These charts provide insights into how selling prices vary across different categories and locations. Overall, the data indicates that larger room types and certain towns like Punggol command higher selling prices, both at minimum and maximum levels.

* 5-room types have the highest sum of maximum selling prices, followed closely by 4-room types.
Discrepancies between the two charts are minimal, likely due to rounding.
Towns:

* Punggol consistently has the highest sums for both minimum and maximum selling prices.
Sengkang and Woodlands also show high values, ranking second and third respectively.
Hougang and Jurong East have the lowest sums in both categories.
There is a significant increase in sums from minimum to maximum selling prices across all towns.
These visualizations and insights can be leveraged for better understanding of the housing market dynamics and for making informed decisions related to real estate investments or policy-making.
